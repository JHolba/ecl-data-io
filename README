ecl-data-io
===========

Extensible parser of the eclipse data input format. This
is a native python parser library for the `.DATA` format used
by many petroleum field simulators. Note that this library is

* Not feature complete, but extensible
* Does not adhere to a single specification, but is flexible
* Can read included files ('.INC' or '.grdecl'), but only
  when the included file follows reasonable conventions.

Overview of parsing
===================

The parser is based on being a collection of subparsers with their own state.
Each subparser is a generator of `Record`s.  These are activated by keywords,
so, for instance, when the parser encounters the `SKIP` keyword, the
`SkipSubparser.parse` generator is called (which has access to the state of all
other subparsers). It then consumes from the file until the `ENDSKIP` keyword
is encountered and yields a `SkippedSection` record. The parser then looks at
keyword on the next line to see which subparser should be called next.

## Non-strict parsing

Since any number of keywords can occurr in a `.DATA` file, we support
non-strict parsing through the `ecl_data_io.parse(strict=False)` parameter,
meaning lines not containing a recognized keyword are ignored until a
recognized keyword is reached.  Note that this might fail to correctly parse a
file. A warning is given when non-strict parsing is encountered.

Default supported keywords
==========================

Comments of the form '--' are built in, and can only be turned off (or changed) by setting
the `ecl_data_io.parse(comment_token='--')` to `None`.

The following keywords are supported by the collection of parsers in
`ecl_data_io.subparsers.DEFAULT_SUBPARSERS`:

* SKIP, SKIP100, SKIP300, ENDSKIP
* COLUMNS
* MESSAGE
